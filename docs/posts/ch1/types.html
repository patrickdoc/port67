            <p><span class="sentence">We can now translate from the hardware into binary, and from binary into decimal.</span> <span class="sentence">But, while numbers are useful, we also want to work with other data.</span> <span class="sentence">One of the simplest data types we want to work with is text.</span> <span class="sentence">We need a way to represent letters in memory.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence">The most common system for converting text to binary is called ASCII.</span> <span class="sentence">ASCII is simply a table that maps bytes to characters.</span> <span class="sentence">Characters include capital letters, lower case letters, digits, and punctuation.</span> <span class="sentence">Here’s a snippet of the table,</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence">Binary | Character 0011 0000 | 0 0011 0001 | 1 0011 0010 | 2 0011 0011 | 2 … 0011 1010 | : 0011 1011 | ; 0011 1100 | &lt; … 0100 0001 | A 0100 0010 | B 0100 0011 | C … 0110 0001 | a 0110 0010 | b 0110 0011 | c</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence">There are some interesting patterns in the table, but mostly it is just an arbitrary definition.</span> <span class="sentence">The basic ASCII table only defines the first 128 values.</span> <span class="sentence">[^1] Over time, new standards have been established that cover more of the characters used around the world.</span> <span class="sentence">But most of them are compatible with ASCII, meaning that they match on the first 128 values.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence">Strangely, it is only 7 bits of data, even though our standard byte is 8 bits.</span> <span class="sentence">Text encoding just happens to be older than the 8 bit standard.</span></p>
<h2 id="types">Types</h2>
<p><span class="sentence">When we wrote our first program, we saw a surprising result.</span> <span class="sentence">To refresh your memory, it looked like this,</span></p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true"></a><span class="dt">int</span> main(<span class="dt">int</span> argc, <span class="dt">char</span>** argv) {</span>
<span id="cb1-2"><a href="#cb1-2" aria-hidden="true"></a>    <span class="cf">return</span> <span class="ch">&#39;A&#39;</span>;</span>
<span id="cb1-3"><a href="#cb1-3" aria-hidden="true"></a>}</span></code></pre></div>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1" aria-hidden="true"></a>$ <span class="fu">cc</span> test.c</span>
<span id="cb2-2"><a href="#cb2-2" aria-hidden="true"></a>$ <span class="ex">./a.out</span></span>
<span id="cb2-3"><a href="#cb2-3" aria-hidden="true"></a>$ <span class="bu">echo</span> <span class="va">$?</span></span>
<span id="cb2-4"><a href="#cb2-4" aria-hidden="true"></a><span class="ex">65</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p><span class="sentence">We told the program to return the letter ‘A’, but instead it returned the number 65.</span> <span class="sentence">If we use our knowledge of binary, decimal, and ASCII, we now know enough to explain the result.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence">Binary | Decimal | Character 0100 0001 | 65 | A</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence">In memory, the number 65 and the letter ‘A’ both correspond to the same byte, the exact same set of charged and uncharged circuits in the hardware.</span> <span class="sentence">The only difference is how we choose to read that byte.</span> <span class="sentence">If we read it as a binary number, the value is 65.</span> <span class="sentence">But if we read it as an ASCII character, the value is the letter ‘A’.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence">ASCII and binary are only two of the ways that we can read bytes of data.</span> <span class="sentence">If you think carefully about binary, you might notice that we don’t have negative numbers.</span> <span class="sentence">Every byte is translated to a positive decimal number.</span> <span class="sentence">We also don’t have fractional numbers, like <code>1.2</code> or <code>3.5</code>.</span> <span class="sentence">Those are called “floating point” numbers and are quite tricky to represent.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence">These data types that we read straight from memory are called “primitive” types.</span> <span class="sentence">They are built-in to C, so we don’t need to worry about exactly how they work.</span> <span class="sentence">But we do need to communicate to the compiler which type it should use to read the data in memory.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence">We communicate this information to the compiler through the “type system”.</span> <span class="sentence">Types are how we work with the compiler to manage memory.</span> <span class="sentence">We provide the type, and the compiler takes care of reading and writing the data in memory.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence">Here are some of the primitive types in C.</span></p>

</table>
<p><span class="sentence"><code>char</code> indicates that a value should be read as an ASCII letter, and <code>unsigned</code> indicates that a value should be read as a binary number.</span> <span class="sentence">The two new ones are <code>int</code> and <code>float</code>.</span> <span class="sentence"><code>int</code> is short for “integer”, or positive and negative numbers.</span> <span class="sentence"><code>float</code> is short for “floating point” which includes the rational numbers.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence">When we write programs, we tell C which type to use for a specific variable.</span> <span class="sentence">We “declare” a variable to have a type when we create it, like this,</span></p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c"><span id="cb3-1"><a href="#cb3-1" aria-hidden="true"></a><span class="dt">int</span> x = <span class="dv">10</span>;</span>
<span id="cb3-2"><a href="#cb3-2" aria-hidden="true"></a><span class="dt">char</span> myVariable = <span class="ch">&#39;c&#39;</span>;</span>
<span id="cb3-3"><a href="#cb3-3" aria-hidden="true"></a><span class="dt">float</span> otherVariable = <span class="fl">1.0</span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p><span class="sentence">C is not very strict with types though, so we can write code that looks like this,</span></p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb4"><pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c"><span id="cb4-1"><a href="#cb4-1" aria-hidden="true"></a><span class="dt">int</span> x = <span class="ch">&#39;A&#39;</span>;</span>
<span id="cb4-2"><a href="#cb4-2" aria-hidden="true"></a><span class="dt">char</span> myVariable = <span class="dv">10</span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p><span class="sentence">But by doing that, we are losing most of the value that types provide.</span></p>
<h2 id="section"></h2>
<p><span class="sentence">Primitive types are useful, but they only represent single values.</span> <span class="sentence">Most useful data is composed of just more than one number or letter.</span> <span class="sentence">If you sign up for an account on a website, you typically have to put in at least your name and email, both of which have multiple characters in them.</span> <span class="sentence">You might also need to input your birthday or phone number which, again, are more than a single value.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence">The final tool we need is the ability to build new types out of the primitive types.</span> <span class="sentence">Once we can do that, we can represent and manipulate any type of data we want.</span></p>
