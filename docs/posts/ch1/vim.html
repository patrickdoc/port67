            <p><span class="sentence">Our last tool for working with the filesystem is Vim.</span> <span class="sentence">Vim is a text-editor.</span> <span class="sentence">Unlike Microsoft Word or Google Docs which have both text and formatting (bold, italics, margins, columns, etc), Vim operates on “plain” text.</span> <span class="sentence">The only data in your file will be the words and spaces you type.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence">Vim is intended to help you write and edit quickly, but it has a bit of a learning curve.</span> <span class="sentence">When you first start, some of the quirks can slow you down.</span> <span class="sentence">After a while though, you’ll start integrating some of the features into your regular use and begin speeding up.</span></p>
<h2 id="opening-and-closing-files">Opening and Closing Files</h2>
<p><span class="sentence">Give yourself a directory to work in.</span> <span class="sentence">Maybe something like this,</span></p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true"></a>$ <span class="bu">cd</span></span>
<span id="cb1-2"><a href="#cb1-2" aria-hidden="true"></a>$ <span class="fu">mkdir</span> projects</span>
<span id="cb1-3"><a href="#cb1-3" aria-hidden="true"></a>$ <span class="bu">cd</span> projects</span>
<span id="cb1-4"><a href="#cb1-4" aria-hidden="true"></a>$ <span class="fu">mkdir</span> vim</span>
<span id="cb1-5"><a href="#cb1-5" aria-hidden="true"></a>$ <span class="bu">cd</span> vim</span></code></pre></div>
<p><span class="sentence">Now open Vim with the command <code>vim</code>.</span></p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1" aria-hidden="true"></a>$ <span class="ex">vim</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p><span class="sentence">You should be greeted by a message that starts with, <code>VIM - Vi IMproved</code> and then includes some information about the version and the author.</span> <span class="sentence">Most importantly, you should have a blinking box in the upper left corner.</span> <span class="sentence">That is your cursor.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence">To put some data in the file, type the letter <code>i</code>, followed by your name, and then the escape key.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence">Once you type something, that welcome message disappears.</span> <span class="sentence">Which is a little bit unfortunate because it contained the instructions on how to quit.</span> <span class="sentence">It’s not obvious how to close Vim once you’ve opened it, so we’ll start there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence">To quit, type <code>:q</code>.</span> <span class="sentence">Note, it should show up at the bottom of the window, not next to your name.</span> <span class="sentence">If it shows up next to your name, press the escape key and try again.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence">You will likely see this error message appear,</span></p>
<pre><code>E37: No write since last change (add ! to override)</code></pre>
<p><span class="sentence">Vim is warning you that you have made changes by typing your name into the file, but have not saved them (“No write”).</span> <span class="sentence">This gives us two options.</span> <span class="sentence">Either we can use <code>!</code> to override the error and discard all our changes.</span> <span class="sentence">The command for that would be <code>:q!</code>.</span> <span class="sentence">Or we could “write” the changes to a file, saving them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence">We are going to write our changes to a file by entering the command <code>:w name</code>.</span> <span class="sentence">Here <code>name</code> is the name we want to use for our new file.</span> <span class="sentence">Now we try to quit again with <code>:q</code>, and it should work successfully.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence">Your file should now be visible in the filesystem.</span></p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb4"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb4-1"><a href="#cb4-1" aria-hidden="true"></a>$ <span class="fu">ls</span></span>
<span id="cb4-2"><a href="#cb4-2" aria-hidden="true"></a><span class="ex">name</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p><span class="sentence">We can open it again for more editing,</span></p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb5"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb5-1"><a href="#cb5-1" aria-hidden="true"></a>$ <span class="ex">vim</span> name</span></code></pre></div>
<h2 id="normal-and-insert-mode">Normal and Insert Mode</h2>
<p><span class="sentence">When you first open Vim, you are in “normal” mode.</span> <span class="sentence">This is where all of Vim’s useful features live, but, just like the instructions for quitting, they are not immediately obvious.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence">If you just reopened your <code>name</code> file after closing it, your cursor should be on the first letter of your name.</span> <span class="sentence">We’re going to append <code>(&lt;your age&gt;)</code> to the end of the line with your name.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence">One way would be to enter “insert” mode by typing <code>i</code>, and then holding the right arrow key or using the mouse to move our cursor to the end of the line.</span> <span class="sentence">These methods work, but are slow and can stress your wrist over time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence">Alternatively, you could do it the Vim way.</span> <span class="sentence">Move your cursor to the first letter of your name if it isn’t there already and press the escape key to ensure you are in normal mode.</span> <span class="sentence">Then type <code>A (&lt;your age&gt;)</code> followed by escape.</span> <span class="sentence">No mouse or arrow keys needed.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence">Here is a slightly more complex example.</span> <span class="sentence">Move your cursor to the end of the line if it isn’t there already.</span> <span class="sentence">Now press <code>b</code> (for “beginning”) to move backwards until your cursor is on your last name.</span> <span class="sentence">Try <code>daw</code> (for “delete a word”).</span> <span class="sentence">It should delete your entire last name.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence">Normal mode is useful, but takes time to learn.</span> <span class="sentence">As you continue to work with Vim, watch for patterns that you regularly follow.</span> <span class="sentence">Watch for when you reach for the mouse, or hold down a key and wait for the cursor to get where you want to go.</span> <span class="sentence">When that happens, it’s usually a good bet that Vim has a faster solution for you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence">You can save and close the <code>name</code> file with <code>:wq</code>.</span></p>
<h2 id="basic-normal-mode-commands">Basic Normal Mode Commands</h2>
<p><span class="sentence">Here are some of the normal mode commands that I use most often.</span> <span class="sentence">Many of them come in lowercase/capital pairs, so I’ve listed them together.</span> <span class="sentence">Feel free to use all, none, or some of these.</span></p>
<pre class="vim"><code>h/j/k/l</code></pre>
<p><span class="sentence">These are your arrow keys: left, down, up, right respectively.</span> <span class="sentence">If you keep your hands on the home row as recommended, your right pointer finger should rest on the <code>j</code> key, which makes these convenient.</span></p>
<pre class="vim"><code>i/I</code></pre>
<p><span class="sentence">Enter insert mode at the cursor position or at the start of the line.</span></p>
<pre class="vim"><code>a/A</code></pre>
<p><span class="sentence">Enter insert mode after the cursor position or at the end of the line.</span></p>
<pre class="vim"><code>o/O</code></pre>
<p><span class="sentence">Enter insert mode on a new line below or above the current line.</span></p>
<pre class="vim"><code>gg/G</code></pre>
<p><span class="sentence">Move to start of file.</span> <span class="sentence">Move to end of file.</span></p>
<pre class="vim"><code>/</code></pre>
<p><span class="sentence">Type <code>/</code> to search a file.</span> <span class="sentence">Press enter to submit your search, and then use <code>n</code> to jump to the next match.</span></p>
<pre class="vim"><code>u</code></pre>
<p><span class="sentence">undo.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence">I would recommend trying the command <code>vimtutor</code> to try out some practical examples.</span></p>
<h2 id="other-options">Other Options</h2>
<p><span class="sentence">Vim is where I spend most of my time while working.</span> <span class="sentence">Most of what I do is reading, writing, and editing files, so it is important for me to be comfortable with my text editor.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence">If you don’t like Vim, there are other text-editors available that work differently.</span> <span class="sentence">The primary competitor in the terminal-based editor category is Emacs.</span> <span class="sentence">But there are also more familiar GUI-based text editors, like Atom and Sublime text.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence">I happened to learn Vim, so that’s what I’ll be using here.</span> <span class="sentence">If you’d like to use one of the other ones, you are welcome to.</span> <span class="sentence">I would recommend giving Vim a chance though; once you get over the initial hump, these commands all just become muscle memory.</span></p>
