<p><span class="sentence">So far we’ve worked with the filesystem through the command line, using commands like <code>ls</code>, <code>cd</code>, and <code>vim</code>.</span> <span class="sentence">We’ve also seen that these commands are just files themselves, although they are full of binary data instead of letters, numbers, and spaces.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence">To work with files from our programs, we are going to need a clearer picture of C’s model of files.</span> <span class="sentence">Whenever we are looking for this information, one reliable source of information is the <code>man</code> (short for manual) pages.</span> <span class="sentence">These can be accessed either with the <code>man</code> command or online.</span> <span class="sentence">For example,</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence">Here’s what the <code>man</code> pages say about <code>stdio</code>.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence">There are a lot of unfamiliar topics there, but we are going to focus on the second sentence,</span></p>
<pre><code>Input and output is mapped into logical data streams and the physical I/O
characteristics are concealed.</code></pre>
<p><span class="sentence">A “logical data stream” is just a sequence of data that can be read one-by-one.</span> <span class="sentence">For a regular text file, the data stream would just be all the characters listed out in order, including all the letters, spaces, and punctuation.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence">By thinking of files as “logical data streams” instead of regular files, we get to play an interesting trick.</span> <span class="sentence">Suppose I asked you to read a book to me.</span> <span class="sentence">You would start at the beginning, read chapter 1, chapter 2, etc, and then get to the end and say “The End!” or something because the book was over.</span> <span class="sentence">The end is well defined, so when you reach the last page, we both know the book is over.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence">However, suppose I asked you to read a text conversation to me.</span> <span class="sentence">You might read a few texts back and forth, and then say “the other person is still typing”.</span> <span class="sentence">The conversation isn’t over, but you don’t have more data yet.</span> <span class="sentence">You can’t predict what the other person is going to say, so we both just have to wait around until you get a response.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence">This is an example of the “physical I/O characteristics” that are concealed.</span> <span class="sentence">The data stream might be connected to a file stored on your hard drive; it might be connected to the terminal waiting for you to type; or it might be connected to something like your mouse!</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence">No matter what the stream is connected to, we will interact with it the same way.</span> <span class="sentence">Similar to allocating memory, we are responsible for creating the stream, and then destroying it when we are done.</span> <span class="sentence">For memory, we <code>malloc</code>’d the memory when we needed it and <code>free</code>’d it when we were done.</span> <span class="sentence">For streams, we will “open” the stream when we need it and “close” it when we are done.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence">If we have a stream opened for a regular file, we can can read, write, and edit it just like we do in Vim.</span> <span class="sentence">In fact, our stream has a “position indicator” very similar to the cursor in Vim.</span> <span class="sentence">If we want to write “hello” at the end of a stream, we first need to move the position indicator to the end of the file.</span> <span class="sentence">If we then want to read the first word of the file, we need to move the position indicator back to the beginning.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence">When you run a program, there are three streams automatically created for you.</span> <span class="sentence">Standard input, or <code>stdin</code>, is a source of input for your program.</span> <span class="sentence">You can read from <code>stdin</code> to get data from users or other programs.</span> <span class="sentence">Standard output, or <code>stdout</code>, is a destination for data that you want to send.</span> <span class="sentence">When you run your program from the command line, the data you send to <code>stdout</code> will be printed in the terminal.</span> <span class="sentence">Standard error, or <code>stderr</code>, is another destination that you can send data to.</span> <span class="sentence">It also will be displayed in the terminal, but it is generally used to report issues instead of regular information.</span></p>
